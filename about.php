<h2>Our Mission</h2>
Our work is an expression of our deep desire to share the beauty we find, and we work hard to provide 
quality at fair prices and solid opportunity for those working with us.<br>
We believe that abundance comes from serving others with honesty and sensitivity, that is why we develop
strong long lasting relationships built on trust.<br>
Our Company's simple goal is to add beauty to the life of each person it touches.<br>
<p>
					<h2>Our Inspiration</h2>
				Founder and CEO Grace Gallo, the force behind our collection, describes her romance
with the ever enchanting pearl and speaks of her next collection:<br><p>

	<blockquote>I was once told: do what you love, the rest will follow. This phrase changed my life
and has given me the courage to go after my dreams. Now I want to share my dream : to
create and inspire with my own collection of beauty.<br>
<p>
	Jewelry has always been my love, especially pearls. They are unique among gemstones 
because they are formed perfectly inside a living being.  That singular fact creates a stone
that requires no cutting or polishing, only to be found. That is why I started my Jewelry
collection with that precious gem.
					<p>	
					
	We believe in creating traditions as well as fulfilling dreams. We perceived our Duchess
collection of pearls to be an investment in life, beauty and happiness. With that in mind,
we created our collection to be affordable to everyone with a quality that will endure
the test of time.<br>
				<p>

<p></blockquote>
<h2>Coming up</h2>
	As a creature of inspiration, my second muse, Venice, has inspired the creation of my
next line of jewelry. Venice is a place filled with unique possibilities and experiences.
You could spend a night under the stars being lulled by the song of your gondola
splashing through the water, or trading masks at an exciting masquerade ball.  Similarly,
Venetian glass can mirror the romance or the excitement of the city in which it is formed;
therefore, it will play the part of sister to my first collection and be the main ingredient to
my second line of jewelry.<br>
(Stay tuned).<br>
